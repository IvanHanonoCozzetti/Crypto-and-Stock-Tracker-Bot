### SMTP
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol, which handles sending e-mail and routing e-mail between mail servers. Python provides smtplib module, which defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.


- host: This is the host running your SMTP server. You can specify IP address of the host or a domain name.
- port: If you are providing host argument, then you need to specify a port, where SMTP server is listening.
- local_hostname (for a local machine only).
